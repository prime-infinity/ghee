# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ghee is a web application that transforms code into intuitive, visual diagrams that explain "what's happening" in the code through icons, arrows, and simple explanations. The tool makes code accessible to anyone, including children, by representing programming logic as visual stories rather than traditional line/graph drawings. The focus is on creating fun, practical visualizations using icons from Lucide React to represent users, databases, clicks, and other programming concepts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Input Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to paste code into a text area, so that I can visualize what the code does.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the ghee homepage THEN the system SHALL display a large text input area with placeholder text "Paste your code here..."
2. WHEN I interact with the input area THEN the system SHALL allow me to paste or type code
3. WHEN I enter JavaScript/TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting
4. WHEN the input area is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Visualize Code" button below the input area

### Requirement 2: Code Processing and Analysis

**User Story:** As a system, I want to parse JavaScript/TypeScript code into an Abstract Syntax Tree, so that I can identify code patterns for visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid JavaScript/TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL successfully parse the code using AST parsing
2. WHEN the system processes code THEN the system SHALL identify common patterns including functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and API calls
3. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL extract data flow relationships between code elements
4. WHEN syntax errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 3: Counter/Button Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a system, I want to recognize React counter patterns, so that I can generate appropriate visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains useState hook with numeric state AND onClick handler that increments state THEN the system SHALL identify this as a "counter pattern"
2. WHEN a counter pattern is identified THEN the system SHALL generate visualization showing Button Icon → "click" arrow → Counter Icon with "+1"
3. WHEN generating counter visualizations THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons from Lucide React library

### Requirement 4: API Call Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a system, I want to recognize API call patterns, so that I can show data flow visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains fetch() or axios calls THEN the system SHALL identify API endpoints and request methods
2. WHEN API patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL generate visualization showing User Icon → Form Icon → "request" arrow → Server Icon → "response" arrow → Component Icon
3. WHEN API calls have error handling THEN the system SHALL show different paths for success and error scenarios

### Requirement 5: Database Operation Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a system, I want to recognize database operations, so that I can illustrate data persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains database operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) THEN the system SHALL show Database Icon connected to appropriate operations
2. WHEN database operations are visualized THEN the system SHALL illustrate data flow between application and database
3. WHEN different query types are present THEN the system SHALL represent them with distinct visual elements

### Requirement 6: Interactive Flow Diagram Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an interactive flow diagram of my code, so that I can understand the code logic visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system has analyzed code THEN the system SHALL generate a flow diagram with connected nodes and arrows
2. WHEN visualization is displayed THEN each node SHALL have appropriate icons (buttons, databases, users, etc.)
3. WHEN arrows are shown THEN they SHALL be labeled with actions ("click", "fetch", "save", etc.)
4. WHEN the diagram is rendered THEN it SHALL flow logically from left to right or top to bottom
5. WHEN I click on nodes THEN the system SHALL show more details

### Requirement 7: Error Path Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see error handling paths in the visualization, so that I understand what happens when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains try-catch blocks or error handling THEN error paths SHALL be shown with red arrows and warning icons
2. WHEN success and error paths exist THEN success paths SHALL be shown with green arrows and success icons
3. WHEN error paths are displayed THEN error messages or types SHALL be displayed near error paths
4. WHEN both paths are present THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguishable

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work on different screen sizes with desktop as default, so that I can use it on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access ghee on different devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately to screen size
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the code input area SHALL remain usable
3. WHEN visualizations are displayed THEN they SHALL be readable and interactive on all screen sizes

### Requirement 9: Simple Explanations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see simple explanations alongside the visual elements, so that I can learn what each part does.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over or click on visual elements THEN the system SHALL show tooltip explanations in simple, non-technical language
2. WHEN explanations are provided THEN they SHALL be appropriate for beginners or children
3. WHEN technical terms are used THEN they SHALL be avoided or clearly explained
4. WHEN explanations are shown THEN they SHALL focus on "what" happens rather than "how" it's implemented

### Requirement 10: JavaScript/TypeScript Language Support

**User Story:** As a system, I want to support JavaScript and TypeScript code, so that users can visualize the most common web development code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs JavaScript or TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL correctly parse both language syntaxes
2. WHEN processing code THEN the system SHALL recognize common patterns in both languages
3. WHEN TypeScript-specific features are present THEN the system SHALL handle types and interfaces appropriately

### Requirement 11: React Component Support

**User Story:** As a system, I want to specifically support React component patterns, so that users can visualize frontend component behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains React components with hooks THEN the system SHALL identify component lifecycle patterns
2. WHEN React components are analyzed THEN the system SHALL show prop flow between components
3. WHEN React state management is present THEN the system SHALL visualize useState and useEffect patterns
4. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL represent component rendering and re-rendering

### Requirement 12: Code Processing Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want code visualization to happen quickly without compromising performance, so that I get immediate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit code for visualization THEN the interface SHALL show a loading indicator during processing
2. WHEN processing takes time THEN I SHALL be able to cancel the processing if needed

### Requirement 13: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong, so that I know how to fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit invalid or unsupported code THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN errors occur THEN suggestions SHALL be provided for fixing common problems
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the application SHALL remain stable and not crash
4. WHEN I encounter errors THEN I SHALL be able to easily try again with corrected code
